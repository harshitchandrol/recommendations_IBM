## Installation

The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries available through the Anaconda package.


## Project Motivation and Description

Across several platforms and economic models, recommendation engines are gaining popularity. In addition to Netflix, other online publishing sites like Medium also employ recommendation systems to help users locate the movies and TV series that are most relevant for them.

Three alternative recommendation system implementation methods have been used in this project.

1. Rank Based Recommendations
2. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Matrix Factorization

## File Description
The entire code is included in a single file called Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb. The supporting datasets for the recommendation systems are included in the data folder.
## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgement

The underlying data used for the analysis comes from Udacity. Feel free to use the code as you please and use it for different recommendation problems.
